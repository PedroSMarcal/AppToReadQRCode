# Mobile APP;

## This Branch it's have a lot of process;

### Installation: 
I used expo to this aplication so now you need to have expo in your machine;

to install the expo you need to have NodeJS already installed if you don't have please use this URL and add the LTS Version:

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

then execute any console you would like, and execute the command 
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
or if you already use yarn
```
yarn --global add -g expo-cli
```
-- 
then clone the repository to your machine where have the package.json, use 
```
npm install 
```
or just 
```
yarn
```
then 
```
expo install
```
to get all the dependencies;

### Before Start the app
**because it isn't in production, go Services-> Api.ts, and change the Route to your computer IPV4, if you open CMD on windown and type ipconfig /all**

**EndereÃ§o IPv4. . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . : 192.168.15.6**
**Something like that** 

then it's just 
```
expo start
```

I developed using the app [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=pt_BR&gl=US) to run and connect my cellphone to build the app;
